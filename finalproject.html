  <p>The Final Project in this module is a test to apply what we have learnt over the course of this academic semester. <br>
  <p> 
    <ul><b>The project can be about anything, provided it met the following criteria:</b>
      <li>A 3D printed item must be present.</li>
      <li>A laser cut item must be present.</li>
      <li>Arduino programming must be included, as well as some wiring of electronics.</li>
    </ul>
    All of the items must play a key role in the project. (e.g. the 3D printed item cannot be there as a placeholder)<br>
    In addition, we needed to make a 1-minute video about the project, an A4 sized poster about it as well as document the processes
    made over the course of this project.<br>
  </p>
  <p> 
  For my Final Project, I decided to try something different. I decided to group up with two of my classmates, <a href="https://justeenie.github.io/home.html">Justin</a> and <a href="https://ngliangg.github.io/DFABWebsite/">Guo Liang</a> to make one big project.<br>
  We decided to make a coin sorter that could count and sort out the newest generation of Singapore coins.<br>
</p>
  <p>
  Before we could start on the project, we had to define what each member had to do. I decided to focus on the input system of the coin sorter.<br>

  <h1>Prototyping</h1>
  <p>To figure out how to make a proper coin sorter, we needed to figure out potential problems we might need to tackle.<br>
  One such problem was ensuring the coins fall one at a time. This would ensure that the coins do not overlap, and gives the counting
  system some time in case the system could only scan one type of coin at a time.
  Next, I had to figure out how the wheel was going to be powered. I initially went with a DC motor as it was the only motor I was 
  given to work with. However, as I would soon find out, the motor was not a good fit. 
</p>
<h1>CAD (3D Modelling)</h1>
<p>To model out the wheel, a few things must be considered.<br>
  Firstly, it has to be slightly thicker than a 5 cent coin. It had to be thin enough to be 3D printable, while ensuring 
  the wheel was not thick enough that any combination of coins could stack and get caught in the wheel simultaneously.<br>
  I decided to make the wheel about 10cm in diameter to make sure the wheel was large enough to make the holes big enough to scoop
  the coins.<br>
  Each hole would be constrained to the tangent of the larger circle as seen in the sketch below.<br>
  ss<br>
  I decided to sketch two lines from the two furthest edges of the circle hole to the edge of the wheel to make sure the coins can sit properly
  in the wheel.<br>
  ss<br>
  With the first hole done, I patterned it along the wheel to make 3 more holes for efficiency's sake.
  Afterwards, I made a hole in the center of the wheel to accomodate the motor which will be powering the wheel.
  Finally, I extruded the wheel to the desired thickness of 1.25mm, which is just slightly thicker than a 5 cent coin. For reference, a 5 cent coin is 1.22mm thick, <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/Singapores-Circulation-Currency-Coins">according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</a>
  A notch was created to improve the stability of the wheel.

  Arduino Case Supports:
  To ensure the Arduino is well anchored into the sorter, I had to make a support box for it. For this model, I decided to reference 
  an old model I had created in this module. I made a copy of the old laser cut box and removed the lid plus hinge systems.<br>
  With the base and sides left, I edited the parametrics to ensure the Arduino UNO can fit. The following changes were made:
  <ul>
    <li>Changed thickness to 5mm</li>
    <li>Adjusted length, with and height.</li>
    <li>Added 2 holes at the side for USB input and battery power.</li>
  </ul>
