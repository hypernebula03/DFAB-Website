  <p> For Computer Aided Design, two assignments were given. One of which was to create a knight chess piece with the following dimensions: 
    <ul>
      <li>30mm base diameter</li>
      <li>50mm height</li>
      <li>5mm head thickness</li>
      <li>Hollowed base</li>
      <li>30mm base diameter</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>To start off, a reference picture is taken so that we can have something to refer to. It is scaled to meet the requirements stated above. <br>
    <img src="./images/3D printing/refimage.png"> <br>
    Next, we sketch out the base. Since we are using a reference image, we will be tracing out half the base 
    using line tools as well as spline curves for curved areas. Due to how we are copying features off a 
    reference image, the 3D model may not be fully accurate and constrained.
    <img src="./images/3D printing/knightbase.png"> <br>
    Afterwards, we use the revolve tool to create the base sketch.

    Before we can start with the rest of the knight chess piece, we have to make the base hollow. To do that,
    the Shell tool is used. The wall thickness is set to 1mm.
    <img src="./images/3D printing/baseshell.png"> <br> 
    Now that the base is complete, we can move on to modelling the head of the knight chess piece. To do that, we
    refer to our reference image and try to trace it to the best of our ability. For this, I used the spline tool to draw
    the curves of this sketch. I also had to project the top of the base so that it can be used as a reference point
    during the sketch. I decided for simplicity's sake, I would not model the mane. This would make the 3D printing faster.
    <img src="./images/3D printing/topsketch.png"> <br>
    The top sketch was extruded to the distance required as stated above (5mm head thickness).
    <img src="./images/3D printing/knighttop.png"> <br>
    Now, time to do the ears. This is a bit complicated as there is no reference plane to do the sketch on. Thus, I had to 
    create a new angled sketching plane right where the ears are.
    <img src="./images/3D printing/earplane.png"> <br>
    With the sketching plane done, I can make the sketch to carve out ears for the knight chess piece. A triangle will be sketched
    and extruded as a "Cut" function instead of a "New Body" function.

    With that, the Knight Chess Piece model is finished. Below is the embedded 3D model itself.

  </p>
  <p>
    The other assignment was to create a music box with a movable lid with parametrics. Having a parametric design allows it to be
    edited seamlessly by changing certain variables instead of editing every single affected part of the 3D model.<br>
    Before we start 3D modelling, we have to set our variables first.<br>
    Here are the variables set in this model.<br>
    (attach ss)<br>
    To start off, we must create a basic box (without the lid).<br>
    A rectangle was first sketched and dimensioned to the length and height mentioned above. One set of tabs is also sketched and 
    dimensioned according to our predefined variables. It is then extruded to our set thickness as a "New Body" operation.<br>
    Next, another extrusion is performed, this time as a "Cut" function to cut away the tabs so that our box can be assembled once laser cut.
    Afterwards, I patterned the tabs twice in two directions, once across the length of the box and along the box height twice (both sides).<br>
    (ss)<br>
    Now that one face is done, the side of the box (width) has to be done. The same process as creating the first face is made, except it
    is anchored to the front edge of the first tab made. It is dimensioned and constrained via our predefined values, and extruded to our
    preset thickness afterwards.<br>
    (ss)<br>
    The tab spacing along the width of the box is cut and patterned along the width.<br>
    (ss)<br>
    Now that one side of the length and width of the box is done, to make it easier I decided to duplicate both plates by mirroring them.
    Before I can do that, I need to create 2 sets of sketching planes at the midpoint of each plate using the midplane tool. Once that
    is done, I can duplicate each face using the mirror tool.<br>
    (ss)<br>
